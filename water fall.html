    <h1>WATER FALL</h1>
    <h2>description:</h2>

<p>It's also one of the best places to see Nosy Be's crater lakes.<br>
 You should not miss a visit to the nice waterfall of Androadroatra with its crystal-clear opal waters.<br> 
A 50m cascade sliding and falling over a wet rock wall all covered with moss and lichen into a natural pool.<br>

It is important to note that the site is considered sacred by its location.<br>
 It is a place of worship for the Sakalava.<br>
 Also, even if swimming is allowed, it's important to learn about the taboos before making oneself comfortable<br>
 because to oppose them would be, according to the natives, a cause for a curse.
