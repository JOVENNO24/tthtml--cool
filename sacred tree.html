<h4>Sacred tree<br></h4>
<p>In Nosy Be, there are several sacred trees of Indian origin, but not all have been blessed and<br>
sacred by royalty. The sacred tree of Mahatsinjo was planted around 1800 in Mahatsinjo by<br>
Indian traders and declared sacred by Queen Sakalava Tsiomeko. Mahatinjo was made<br>
sacred because it is the place of the first installation of the queen on the island of Nosy Be<br>
after her exile, she stayed there for more than 6 months with 12 000 people before settling<br>
on Hell town. Today, this place remains a high place of worship and prayer for the Sakalava<br>
people. Each month, over 300 Malagasy and foreigners come to pray in this sacred place, to<br>
do so they make wishes and when it is realized, offerings are deposited. In general we offer<br>
honey, rum, coins or red and white fabrics. And for the biggest demands and events, a zebu.<br>
The newlyweds often go there to make wishes and solicit the blessing of God through the<br>
ancestors, for the durability of their life as couples.<br><p>
