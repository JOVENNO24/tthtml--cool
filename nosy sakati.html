    <h1>NOSY SAKATIA</h1>
    <h2>description:</h2>
<p>Sakatia is known for its flowers but also it has many other riches.<br>
Nosy Sakatia is only 6 km long and 2 wide .<br> 
it is the most authentic island of archipelago Nosy Be (protected and classified by the Ministry of Environment). <br>
The inland is pretty hilly and it offers beautiful hikes, especially at higher elevations.<br>
Experience on an island recognized and protected as a Nature Reserve.<br>
Sea and sun punctuate the culture and traditional activities of the inhabitants: fishermen, artisans, children and the elderly are immersed<br>
 in everyday life to the rhythm of an astonishing nature.<br>
The coral reef is easily reached by swimming. <br>
The island is world famous for its natural pools located under the Sacred Mountain.<br>
The depths rich in poseidonia are the ideal habitat<br>
for giant sea turtles: these turtles are so accustomed to the harmless movement of the fishermen with their motorless pirogues <br>
 that the human presence has become familiar. You will swim very close to them.<br></p>
